You take some moss and grass to make up a soft bed under one of the trees. Soon you fall 
asleep and a strange dream about a fox and a coyote starts to evolve. The fox with its
black paws leave perfect tracks in the blanket of snow. In the thicket you notice yellow,
piercing eyes looking diretly at the fox.
